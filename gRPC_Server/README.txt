This is the HEART of the project. This is the 1st project that you need to run. It also is the one that communicates with db using jdbc. Later you can chose a simple tool like BLOOM RPC to call your api too. But you need to run the REST API project "REST_CLIENT" for the 4 layer architecture. you can also test ur API calls by HARDCODED gRPC client project  "Hardcoded_gRPC_client"
